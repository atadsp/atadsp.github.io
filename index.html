<h1>Christopher Beckman</h1>

<p>
My name is Chris Beckman, I was born in Indiana and I have lived there all of my life. I am eger to delve into the world of digital media and emerse myself in all the aspects of it. I love to tell stories and I love to experience them as well. All parts of production appeal to me from pre to post. 
</p>
<p>
I have a good deal of experience in video production and sound design. Sound in particular is my strongest field. I love the way I can manipulate the sound waves to form something entirely new, or to make a music score sound absolutely fantastic. 
</p>
<p>
I work well with others and I try my hardest to be a team player. The more I can do for a project them more fufiled I feel about it. I love work with people and collaberate to make the project truely fantastic.
