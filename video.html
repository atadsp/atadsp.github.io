   				<p> When you are pushed to far by everything around you, even those you love, your mind begins to warp and twist until you find yourself capable of doing things that normally you would never consider doing.  </p>
   				<P> On this project I worked with five other people to develop the story and produce the feature. I primiarily did audio work for the film and I was responsible for assembling the score and doing the final mixdown. </P>

   				<p> The Adventures of Andrew Alexander Abraham and Fiona is a radio broadcast that runs every now and then. It follows the main character: Andrew Alexander Abraham and his dashing damsal compainion Fiona as they tangel with the evil ganster Evil Even McEwan.  </p>
   				<P> This project is all about the audio and while it is a slightly older project now I still think that it is a great display of my skill in audio engineering. </P>
