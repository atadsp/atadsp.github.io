        	<h3> MEAM.JS Boiler Plate - Super Duper Mart</h3>
            <p> There is a fantastic template out there that allows web developers to quickly scrub out websites using the MEAN stack. Theses sites are basic and require a lot of additional work to get to any sort of professional standard.  I took this boiler plate and added additional functionality to it. Primarily it had to do with interlinking the various sub-pages so that the various tables on the database could talk with one another. The theme of the website is based of the video game franchise called Fallout, produced by Interplay Entertainment, Black Isle Studio, Micro Forte, Bethesda Game Studios, and Obsidian Entertainment. </p>

        	<h3> Vertellus.com</h3>
            <p> While I did not code the vertellus website I was partially responsible for maintaince of the website and updating the graphics as needed. Many of the graphics that are currently on the website were designed by me or modified to better suit the needs of the company. I also did a lot of work on the back end of the website in transfering files from an older server FileNet to a new server at SharePoint. </p>

        	<h3> Marill</h3>
            <p> When I first discorvered codepen I used it to design a creature using nothing but HTML and CSS. This is the result of that work. Its from the franchise Pokemon and is a tailless version of the pokemon Marill who is one of the easiest to replicate and thus made a good canidate for practising HTML/CSS design. </p>
